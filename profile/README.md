> "えお、私たちはかわいいよ" - *Yes, we are cute!* (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

## Who We Are 🌟

We're just a bunch of nerds who decided that building silly stuff together is way more fun than doing it alone! Sometimes we make useful things... but mostly we're here for the memes and the glory of saying "IT WORKS!" at 3 AM.

## Our Mission 🚀

1. Code cool stuff
2. Break things (accidentally, mostly)
3. Fix what we broke (eventually)
4. Have fun while doing it all
5. Pretend we know what we're doing (⌐■_■)

## How We Work 🤪

1. Someone has a "brilliant" idea at midnight
2. We get way too excited about it
3. Coding frenzy ensues
4. Coffee supplies critically depleted
5. Something weirdly amazing emerges
6. We celebrate like we just saved the world
