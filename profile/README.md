# アイリス (Iris) Organization ✨

> "えお、私たちはかわいいよ" - *Yes, we are cute!* (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

## Who We Are 🌟

We're just a bunch of nerds who decided that building silly stuff together is way more fun than doing it alone! Sometimes we make useful things... but mostly we're here for the memes and the glory of saying "IT WORKS!" at 3 AM.

## Our Mission 🚀

1. Code cool stuff
2. Break things (accidentally, mostly)
3. Fix what we broke (eventually)
4. Have fun while doing it all
5. Pretend we know what we're doing (⌐■_■)

## Meet The Dream Team 👥

- **Me (Vincent)** - *Backend Engineer & Admin* - Writes Go code so elegant it makes gophers cry. Can use TypeScript with Bun but prefers to tell everyone how much better Go is. Has root access and isn't afraid to use it! ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ

- **Yannis** - *Full Stack TS Dev* - Legend says he dreams in TypeScript and cries in JSX. Can build an entire app during a coffee break. Secretly believes any problem can be solved with "just one more npm package." (￣ω￣)

- **Melvin** - *The Flutter GOAT* - Has a strange obsession with drawing rectangles that somehow become beautiful apps. Talks to his rubber duck about state management more than he talks to real people. ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

- **Stouph** - *Cloud Architect* - Head perpetually in the clouds. Will give a 30-minute talk about infrastructure scaling when you just asked if the server is up. Has a concerning amount of AWS stickers. (っ˘ω˘ς )

- **Jawad** - *Architect & Quant Gifted* - The human calculator who makes algorithms cry. Can optimize your code and your investment portfolio simultaneously. Never seen without at least 3 monitors. (￣^￣)ゞ

- **Souhib** - *Backend Pythonista* - Writes Python code so beautiful it should be in a museum. Secretly judges everyone who doesn't use proper indentation. Has strong opinions about virtual environments that nobody asked for. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

- **Alex** - *React Lover Chad* - Can create a React component faster than you can say "useEffect". Has "Think in React" tattooed somewhere. Casually drops "well, actually this would be more efficient as a pure component" in normal conversations. Will fight anyone who suggests using anything but React. ᕦ( ᴼ ڡ ᴼ )ᕤ

## How We Work 🤪

1. Someone has a "brilliant" idea at midnight
2. We get way too excited about it
3. Coding frenzy ensues
4. Coffee supplies critically depleted
5. Something weirdly amazing emerges
6. We celebrate like we just saved the world
